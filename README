makes a small statically linked root
the main idea is to have a little statically linked set of tools in a home directory
on the cluster at work, where LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PATH gets changed all the time,
that I can use as a baseline set of tools that always work

So far git, binutils, sbase, curl, oksh, curl, etc all seem to work
